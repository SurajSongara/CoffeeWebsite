    <p>Coffee preparation is the process of turning coffee beans into a beverage. While the particular steps vary with the type of coffee and with the raw materials, the process includes four basic steps; raw coffee beans must be <a href="roasting.html">roasted</a> , the roasted coffee beans must then be <a href="grinding.html">ground</a>, the ground coffee must then be mixed with hot water for a certain time <a href="brewing.html">(brewed)</a> , and finally the liquid coffee must be separated from the used grounds.</p>
    <p>Coffee is usually brewed immediately before <a href="drinks.html">drinking</a>. In most areas, coffee may be purchased unprocessed, or already roasted, or already roasted and ground. Coffee is often vacuum packed to prevent oxidation and lengthen its shelf life.</p>
